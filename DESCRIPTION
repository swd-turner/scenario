Description: Uses the neural gas algorithm to construct
    a scenario tree for use in multi-stage stochastic programming.
    The primary input is a set of initial scenarios or realizations
    of a disturbance. The scenario tree nodal structure must be
    predefined using a scenario tree nodal partition matrix.
